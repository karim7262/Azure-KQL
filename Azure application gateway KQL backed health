CPU utilization has been replaced by Capacity Units. A capacity unit consists of following parameters:

So, an alert can be set up for this metric. You can check your maximum capacity unit usage in the last one month and set an alert if it crosses 75% of it. 
 
In terms of autoscaling, you can set minimum and maximum instance count to any value, you will only be billed for the Capacity Units that are actually utilized. When defining minimum instance count, you can check the Compute unit metric, which is a representation of your gatewayâ€™s CPU utilization.  Based on your peak usage divided by 10, you can set the minimum number of instances required. When having a value here that is too low, and AppGW experiences higher than normal traffic, each new instance required to process the load will take 6-7 min to be deployed.

Both Capacity and Compute units can be monitored from the portal Metrics.
